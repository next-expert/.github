# 🌱 Back to the Roots of Technology

We face a world full of over-packaged technology in our work and studies. 😩 Damn, there are all sorts of bizarre frameworks, artificially invented new concepts, and all kinds of so-called "cutting-edge" techniques. 🤯 My god, even if Newton were reborn, he’d probably have to beg these tech gurus, “Please slow down, my brain is already OOM!” 🧠💥

As the old saying goes, **"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."** ✨  
Technology should be **pure, simple, and great**. 🌟  
These truly great technologies are the roots—carefully cultivated and nurtured by the best programmers. 🌱👨‍💻👩‍💻

But over time, things have started to grow wildly.  
Many programmers act like gardeners, showing off the flowers they’ve bred to the world. 🌸🌼🌻  
Newcomers are dazzled by the blooms, but flowers have seasons—they will eventually wither and die. 🍂

Our time and energy are limited. ⏳  
Why focus only on the flowers?  
Instead, why not crouch down with the best and dig deep into the soil? 🪴🤝  
**You, too, can be the next expert.** 🚀
